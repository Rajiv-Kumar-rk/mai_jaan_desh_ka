                    <p class="text-left name">A far cry from duty ashore, challenges and responsibilities are the hallmark of life at sea. At sea, the Captain leads his team of officers and sailors. In the “good old days”, ships were propelled by sails harnessing the power of the winds. Work on ships involved extensive rope-work, swabbing decks and polishing brass. But today’s ships have specialist sensor operators, guided missiles, homing torpedoes, complex machinery and state-of-the art communication networks etc.<br><br>

                    Work on board ships is divided amongst teams that do different kinds of jobs. They could be involved in the operation of various equipment such as radars, sonars or communications, or firing of weapons such as missiles, guns, or rockets. Other diverse teams involve Chefs, Stewards, Medical Assistants and others who are additionally trained to work with weapons. For each naval personnel, skills, knowledge, abilities, resolve, physical and mental toughness are put to test at sea. ‘Sea duty’ does not mean being at sea at all times. Each ship will have its own ‘home-port’ and personnel spend a fair amount of time in or close to the port. At sea, personnel visit far-flung places in India and abroad, which may only have been read or heard about. While you are at sea, the Navy looks after the welfare of your family like its own.<br><br>
                        
                    Modern ships, submarines and aircraft of the Indian Navy are highly sophisticated and technologically advanced platforms. Onboard ships, men are involved in operating the state-of-the art weapons, navigational systems, communication sets, diving equipment, etc. It involves maintenance of equipment. Personnel go through training in the art of seamanship, operating weapons and sensors, look-out duties, boat-work and man-management. All personnel are also trained in Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Warfare and Damage Control including Fire Fighting.<br>

                    A far cry from duty ashore. For one thing, while at sea, you will be putting all your skills and determination to actual test. You will be given responsibility and will be doing an important job for which you have been uniquely trained.<br><br>

                    Of course, sea duty does not mean you will spend all your time at sea. Your ship will have its own ‘home-port’ and you will spend a fair amount of your time in or close to that port. At sea, you will be excited to visiting far-flung places in India and abroad, which you may have only read or heard about.<br><br>
                        
                    Life at sea is full of challenges and immense satisfaction. While you are at sea, the Navy looks after the welfare of your family like its own.<br><br>
                        
                    Whether on a ship or submarine, sailors are provided with sufficient living spaces. Each sailor is assigned a “berthing area,” which includes a locker for storage, as well as a “bunk” for sleeping. The chefs in the galleys (kitchen) constantly prepare food for hundreds of men. There are dining halls for the men to dine. Mess decks are not just areas to sleep, but are also for recreation – sailors can kick back and watch television or play games.<br>

                    <p class="text-left name">
                    Never underestimate the value of time that you served in the Navy. Your naval career will have stood you in very good stead for civil employment. The industry recognises the high level of training, responsibility, reliability and management skills of Service personnel. The leadership skills that you acquire will give you a distinct advantage over others in the civil world.<br><br>

                    If you decide to pursue your career in the Navy for 15 years as a sailor or 20 years as an Artificer or 20 years as an Officer, you qualify for a life-long pension. Think about it: By the age of 35 to 45 you could choose to retire from service with an assured monthly pay check for the rest of your life. This will supplement what you will receive as pay in your second career.<br><br>
